# ELECTRICAL-POWER-SYSTEMS
this contains functions for power systems analysis 

the comments in the code are currently in Spanish but there going to be translated to English in the near future.

The sep module must be in the same folder as the Gauss seidel for it to work correctly.
The 2 text files must also be in the same folder, they are the tables that the program uses to work.
In the bar data table in the node type column write in lowercase letters if it is: "slack", "pq" or "pv", because depending on the type is the code that processes it, for the slack in the column of pg (real power generated) and qg (reactive power generated) you can put any number, it only has to be integer or floating, it is only so that the space is not blank, the same for the pv node in the column of qd (reactive power demanded).
